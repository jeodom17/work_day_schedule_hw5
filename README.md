In this project you will find a daily planner that stores the user input locally and stays if browser is refreshed.

The current day of the week and date will be displayed at the top of the page. Example format below:
Friday, September 24th, 2021

When viewing the time blocks (user input areas) for that day,each time block is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future as follows: gray for past time, red for present time, and green for future times.
